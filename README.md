# LoRaWAN Gateway

This repository provides insights and relevant information about the LoRaWAN ecosystem, with a primary focus on building a LoRaWAN-compatible gateway. The main objective is to develop a gateway capable of receiving data from an end-node and forwarding it to The Things Network (TTN). To achieve this, we will explore the three key components of a LoRaWAN network: the *end-node*, the *gateway*, and the *network server*. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the concepts, components, and configuration involved, with an emphasis on gateway development.
